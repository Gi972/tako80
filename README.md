**tako80** is a free and open source *fantasy console* inspired by [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php). With **tako80** you can create, play and share videogames that have the nice retro style of vintage consoles.

**tako80** runs in the browser making it easy to share your games. The development is done with Javascript and the API is very easy to use. It doesn't impose any limitation such as a maximum number of sprites or a limited size of the source code.
